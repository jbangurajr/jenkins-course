Jenkins is one of the most popular tools used worldwide for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

Jenkins is a free and open-source automation server. It enables developers to build, integrate, and test code automatically as soon as it is committed to the source repository. This enables developers to detect errors and bugs at an early stage and deploy more swiftly.

It helps in better collaboration between the developers as it takes the latest code and triggers a build as soon as it is added to the shared repository by any developer and notifies if the build was successful or not saving the time and effort by not wasting time looking for bugs.
